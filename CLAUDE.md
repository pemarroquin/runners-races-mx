# CLAUDE.md — Runners' Races MX

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repo, including the Mon+Fri
**race-watch** cloud routine. Read this before touching
`assets/data/races.json`.

## The sweep contract (read this first)

A verification sweep's job is to **correct the data**, not to describe what it
found. The three fields `status` / `statusNote` / `lastVerified` are the *audit
trail for a change* — they are never the change itself.

**Write the corrected field first. Then explain it in `statusNote`.**

This is not a style preference. On 2026-08-10 an audit found six records where
a sweep had proved something and written it only in prose:

- **Carrera SABA Monterrey** — the sweep confirmed the start had moved to Av.
  Pedro de Alba, Ciudad Universitaria UANL, and wrote that in `statusNote`.
  `venue` still said `Parque Fundidora`, `city` still said Monterrey (the new
  venue is in San Nicolás), and `start` still pinned the map ~4 km away. The
  app showed runners the wrong start line.
- **Medio Maratón Ensenada** — the sweep proved, with official `ensenada.gob.mx`
  start *and* results coverage, that the race had already been run on 17 May.
  `date` stayed `2026-08-17`, so the app kept advertising it as upcoming in
  seven days, with a live signup link and no checkout gate.

So, when a sweep finds something:

| Finding | Field to write | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Venue moved | `venue`, and `city`/`start` if the municipality or coordinates changed | note it |
| Date wrong / race already run | `date` | note it |
| Race canceled | `status: 'canceled'` **and** `signupUrl: null` | note it |
| Postponed, new date unknown | `date: null`, `status: 'changed'` **and** `signupUrl: null` | note it |
| Start time found or corrected | `time` | note it |
| Current-edition registration found | `signupUrl` | note it |
| Nothing changed | `status: 'ok'` | short note |

### `statusNote` is user-facing

It renders verbatim in the orange banner on the race detail screen, for
`changed` and `canceled` only. Keep it to a few plain sentences a runner can
act on. Everything about *how* you verified — which site was blocked, which
calendars disagreed, confidence changes — goes in `sourceNotes`, which users
never see. Same split as `notes` vs `sourceNotes`.

**Spanish is the app's default locale.** Every `changed`/`canceled` record must
carry a `statusNoteEs`. `notes` has the same rule via `notesEs`.

### Conflicts are recorded, not resolved silently

Two sources disagree → keep the better-evidenced value, write the conflict in
`sourceNotes`. Never guess. Unknown stays `null` — a `null` is a valid finding,
a plausible guess is data poisoning.

## Validate before committing

```bash
npm run verify-sweep                          # static invariants
node scripts/verify-sweep.mjs --base main     # + "narrated but not applied"
npx tsc --noEmit
npx expo export -p web
```

`scripts/verify-sweep.mjs` enforces the contract above. Its sharpest check is
diff-aware: if a record declares `status: 'changed'` and bumps `lastVerified`
but no user-visible field differs from the base ref, that is the exact defect
described here and it fails the build. Run against the pre-fix data, it catches
both incidents above by name.

CI runs it on every pull request and every push to main
(`.github/workflows/data-check.yml`).

## Repo gotchas

- **`deploy.yml` is push-to-main only.** Before `data-check.yml` existed, pull
  requests ran *no checks at all* and a green PR proved nothing. Data and type
  checks now run on PRs; the deploy still only runs on main.
- **The race-watch routine commits to `main` every Mon + Fri**, touching only
  `races.json`. Any branch editing that file will conflict on rebase — resolve
  per hunk (keep upstream's `status`/`statusNote`/`lastVerified`, keep the
  branch's other fields). Never blanket `--ours` / `--theirs`.
- **The bundled seed is not what users see.** The app fetches
  `assets/data/races.json` from `main` on every open and replaces its in-memory
  copy wholesale (`REMOTE_RACES_URL` in `src/lib/races.ts`). Data edited on a
  branch reaches nobody until that branch merges to `main`.
- A record that fails `isValidRace()` in `src/lib/races.ts` is silently
  **dropped** at runtime, so a schema slip reads as "races disappeared", not as
  an error. `verify-sweep.mjs` mirrors that validator.
- `_meta.count` is not read by the app, but it drifted to 114 against 195 real
  records because sweeps never touched it. The gate now checks it.

## Territory Mode — the two boards

Two leaderboards, and they measure different things on purpose. Do not merge
them, and do not add a scope picker to either.

**The arena is an H3 res-7 district** (`src/lib/district.ts`), ~5.16 km² and
~2.8 km across — the ground you are standing in, resolved locally with no
table, no migration and no round trip. It is NOT a municipio: nothing here
can resolve a lat/lng to one, and deriving it from park cells was measured at
21.3% ambiguous. This is the Pokémon GO / Ingress answer — the grid IS the
region.

`districtOf()` truncates the position's own tile; it must NEVER call
`latLngToCell(lat, lng, 7)` directly. H3's hierarchy is index truncation, not
geometry, so those differ near a boundary and a runner would be shown a
district their own tiles fall outside of. Monterrey happens to agree either
way, so this only shows up in other cities — a test asserts it across eight
base cells worldwide.

- **Board 1, CONQUEST** (`districtConquest`) — share of the ground *anyone
  holds* in the district. Changes hands the moment somebody else runs there.
  Ranked by cells held. The denominator is claimed ground, not the district's
  own 16 807 cells: that was measured at 0.02-2.39% for every real runner and
  never moves. How much of the district is untouched is a separate caption.
- **Board 2, LOCAL LEADERS** (`src/lib/mayorship.ts`) — mayorship per CELL,
  by distinct days present in a trailing 30. One point per day, so nobody
  buys a title with one huge Sunday; ties hold with the incumbent. Cannot be
  taken in a single visit.

**Nothing is ever named.** User-created `areas` were deleted outright — the
prompt, the overlap-suggest, the delete window, every string. Board 2's unit
is the grid, so a park and "a street block near my house" work through the
same code with no special case, and areas EMERGE from contiguous held cells.
Do not revive `areas` in any form.

**The leaderboard depends on no hand-applied migration, deliberately.** See
`leaderboard.ts`'s header: a board reading 0% because nobody ran the SQL is
indistinguishable from one reading 0% because nobody ran.

## Gotchas this repo has actually shipped

- **Safari has no `geolocation` in the Permissions API, so every permission
  check is a real GPS probe.** `requestPermission()` (geolocation.web.ts)
  rejects out of `navigator.permissions.query` on Safari and falls through to
  `getCurrentPosition` — a native prompt plus up to a 10 s timeout. Anything
  awaiting it is frozen for that whole window, so NEVER put state the user
  is waiting to see behind it. Checkpoint recovery did exactly that and
  rendered a recovered 40-minute run as `0:00 | 0 m | Searching for GPS
  signal…` until the probe returned, which reads as "Resume did nothing"
  (reported on a real phone, fixed in PR #43 — restored values now go on
  screen before the await; only `legStartRef` waits, so the clock doesn't
  count time spent at a permission prompt).
- **Never drop the only offer of a recoverable run before the recovery
  succeeds.** `resumeCheckpoint` hid the Resume/Discard prompt on tap; when
  the permission probe then refused, the runner landed on "New session" with
  no way back, while the run sat untouched in localStorage. Losing the offer
  is indistinguishable to the runner from losing the run.
  `restoreFromCheckpoint` returns a boolean now and the offer is restored on
  false. The checkpoint on disk is only ever cleared by a successful save, a
  reset, or an explicit Discard — verify that stays true.

- **A cleanup that touches the map runs AFTER the map is destroyed.** On
  unmount React runs effect cleanups in declaration order, so the mount
  effect's `map.remove()` goes first and mapbox-gl leaves `style` undefined
  behind it. `track-map.web.tsx`'s shimmer cleanup then called
  `if (map.getLayer(...))` on that corpse — and `getLayer` is itself what
  throws on a removed map, so the guard written to make the call safe WAS
  the crash. With no error boundary anywhere, React unmounted the whole tree:
  a blank white page on every single tap of Finish, holding the only copy of
  a finished run. Any cleanup touching a captured `map` must first ask
  whether it is still the live one (`mapRef.current === map &&
  readyRef.current`) — never rely on cleanup order, and never assume a
  Mapbox getter is safe on a destroyed map. Fixed 2026-09-09 (PR #41), which
  also added `MapErrorBoundary` around the maps so a map crash can never
  again cost a run.
- **Reproducing a web-only crash: drive real Chrome over CDP with a
  synthetic `navigator.geolocation`.** A phone gives you a blank screen and
  no stack. `--headless=new --use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader
  --enable-unsafe-swiftshader` (Mapbox needs WebGL), install the stub via
  `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`, and define it with
  `Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'geolocation', ...)` — a plain
  assignment gets replaced and reads back as PERMISSION_DENIED. Move the
  fake runner at ~3.3 m/s: faster than a real pace and every fix is
  correctly rejected, so the run records 0 m and you debug your own harness.
  Note Chrome REPLAYS a previous page's console errors when you re-attach,
  so confirm a fix in a FRESH profile before believing the exception is gone.

- **A data migration can be too big for the SQL editor.** `park_path_cells`
  sat empty for a day after the schema shipped because
  `20260908211500_park_paths_data.sql` is 1.4 MB and the Supabase SQL editor
  refuses anything near ~1 MB ("Query is too large to be run via the SQL
  Editor") — so "Park-path progress per municipio" rendered nothing, the RPC
  returning `[]` rather than an error. Loaded 2026-09-09 (36,193 cells, every
  municipio matching its `park_path_stats` denominator). Re-split a refreshed
  extraction with `node scripts/split-park-paths-sql.mjs [--bytes N]`: it
  emits ~300 KB chunks into the gitignored
  `supabase/generated/park-paths-chunks/` as `unnest(array[...])` (~2.3x
  denser than one tuple per row), idempotent and order-independent. Confirm
  with a live count — this is the standing failure mode here: an unapplied
  migration reads as an honest `0`.
- **A ref cannot wake an effect.** `track-map.web.tsx` gated eight effects on
  a `readyRef`; two of them depended only on `active` and so never ran at all
  when a session started before the map loaded — silently removing the
  camera's browse hold. Readiness is state now. When gating an effect on
  readiness, ask what re-runs it.
- **`npm run measure-holes`** — read-only, anon key. Reports the size
  distribution of holes in every runner's covered ground and what the shipped
  `noiseHoles()` would fill. Run it before changing `MAX_NOISE_HOLE_CELLS`;
  the cap sits in a measured gap (nothing between 3 cells / 56 m and 9 cells
  / 110 m) and a different city could move it.
- **`holesOf()` is the ONE hole pipeline.** `enclosedCells` is it flattened,
  `noiseHoles` is it capped, `measure-holes` reports on it. Three copies
  existed briefly; `gap-policy.ts` exists only because two places once
  applied the same caps themselves and disagreed.
- **Measure a denominator against production before shipping a percentage.**
  Two denominators for one number were written down as decided and then
  measured to be unusable. A percentage is a claim about a denominator.

## Project shape

React Native + Expo (SDK 57, expo-router, TypeScript). `npx expo start`, then
Expo Go on device — no store builds. Bilingual, Spanish default
(`src/lib/i18n.tsx`). Local-first, no backend: bundled seed refreshed from
GitHub on open, SQLite saved list (`src/lib/db.ts`), `expo-calendar`,
`react-native-webview` for sponsor checkout. Web preview auto-deploys to
runningapp.pmarroquin.com on push to `main`.

For discovery of *new* races (adding a city, refreshing a calendar), use the
`race-research` skill — that's a different job from this pre-race verification.

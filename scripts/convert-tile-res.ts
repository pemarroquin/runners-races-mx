// Rebuilds every stored territory tile at the CURRENT tile resolution, and
// writes the result as a SQL migration for a human to review and apply.
//
// Why this exists: DEFAULT_TILE_RES changed from 11 to 12 on 2026-09-07
// (owner's call — see tiles.ts). H3 cell ids encode their own resolution, so
// res-11 rows and res-12 rows can never collide, share, or replace each
// other. Left alone, every tile claimed before the change would simply stop
// counting: the app would render and total only res-12 cells and the old
// territory would sit in the table, invisible. This converts it.
//
// It REBUILDS FROM `runs.raw_path`, it does not split old cells into their
// seven children. That distinction is the whole point:
//
//   - Splitting a parent claims all seven children, including ground up to
//     ~29 m from where the runner actually was. A res-11 cell was claimed
//     because the path clipped it — its children cover a lot the path never
//     touched. That would invent territory, which is the one thing this
//     codebase refuses to do (see gap-policy.ts and pathToTiles' bridge
//     caps: an unknown is left as a hole, never guessed).
//   - The path is still stored for every run (`runs.raw_path`, jsonb,
//     `[[lat,lng,ts], ...]`), so the honest answer is recoverable exactly.
//     Despite the column name that path is the privacy-MASKED one: uploadRun
//     writes raw_path from the same `run.points` it passes to pathToTiles,
//     and index.tsx's save() sets that to `masked.points`. So rebuilding
//     from it reproduces the app's original input exactly — it cannot claim
//     ground inside a privacy zone that the first claim excluded.
//
// It imports the app's OWN pathToTiles rather than reimplementing it, so the
// converted tiles are computed by the same code, with the same gap policy
// and bridge caps, that produced the originals. That is why this file is
// TypeScript run through vite-node (which resolves the `@/` alias from
// vitest.config.ts) instead of a plain .mjs like the other scripts.
//
// Read-only against the database. It writes nothing: the anon key it uses
// cannot insert territory_tiles for another session anyway (RLS:
// `auth.uid() = owner_id`) and there is no delete policy at all, which is
// exactly why the conversion has to be SQL applied by hand.

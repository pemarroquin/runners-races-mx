// Re-checks what every run CLAIMED against what its stored path can justify.
//
// Conquest removed the guarantee that ownership cannot be stolen. The server
// still bounds SCALE (the isoperimetric ceiling in claim_run_tiles) but
// nothing ties the claimed cells to the claimed path — the check that would
// do that needs lat/lng -> cell inside Postgres, and the h3 extension is not
// available on this instance (see supabase/blocked/). So the tie is made
// here instead, after the fact.
//
// DETECTION, NOT PREVENTION, and deliberately so. At one user that is the
// right proportion, and it buys something prevention would not: the visits
// check runs the app's OWN pathToTiles and gap-policy, so there is no second
// implementation to drift. Re-implementing that in SQL was the alternative,
// and this repo already has the scar from that pattern — gap-policy.ts
// exists only because the recorder and the tile builder each applied the
// caps themselves and disagreed about one real gap.
//
// ENCLOSURE is the exception, and not by oversight: it is checked against a
// bounding box rather than by re-running enclosedCells, because the path
// stored here is the privacy-MASKED one. See OFF_PATH_MARGIN_M below.
//
// Read-only. Uses the anon key and the read-all policies; it cannot modify
// or delete anything. Same posture as audit-territories.mjs.

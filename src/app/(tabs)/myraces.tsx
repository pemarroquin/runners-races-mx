// The Saved tab — two collections behind one segmented switch: the races
// you've bookmarked, and the territories you've captured in Territory Mode.
// Pedro's call (2026-08-27): past fences live HERE, not on the live Track
// map — a run-history surface, not run-time chrome.
//
// Territories redesign (2026-09-02, Pedro's ask): one map showing every
// saved territory at once (fit to bounds around ALL of them, however far
// the spread — his call over per-city scoping), not a scrolling list of
// fence-card thumbnails. Tapping a territory opens a detail card with its
// stats and actions. A run still in the offline retry queue (see
// upload-queue.ts) shows too, in a visually distinct PENDING state — Pedro,
// mid-session: "let's show it on the unified map but ... a different state
// that reflects that area haven't been uploaded", with Retry/Delete in its
// card; it promotes to the normal saved look automatically the moment its
// upload succeeds.

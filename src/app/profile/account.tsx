// Profile › Account — everything about WHO the runner is, on one page:
// their account, the diagnostics for it, and the name they appear under.
// Filename/route renamed from `profile.tsx`/`/settings/profile` 2026-09-17
// when the whole stack moved to `/profile` — see this directory's
// `_layout.tsx` — so the outer hub and this inner row don't share a name.
//
// The account controls used to be a sibling page (/settings/account) reached
// by its own row. Pedro's call, 2026-09-09: fold them in here, in that order.
// They are three answers to one question, and splitting them meant a runner
// whose territory had gone missing had to guess which of two rows to open —
// while Diagnostics, the screen that answers it, lived under the row they
// did not pick.
//
// Order is deliberate and is the order of escalation: what account am I
// (AccountLink) → what does the server actually hold for it
// (IdentityDiagnostic) → what do other people see (the leaderboard name).
// Each section carries its own heading; see Section below for why they are
// not index.tsx's GroupLabel.
//
// The name field itself moved out of the old single-file settings screen
// unchanged: same refetch-on-focus effect, same lastSyncedName dirty check,
// same save-on-blur. `useIsFocused` now means "this sub-page is on top of
// the profile stack" rather than "the settings tab is selected", which is
// if anything a tighter fit for the reason the effect exists — NamePrompt
// (the run-summary flow) can write display_name from off-screen while this
// screen stays mounted.

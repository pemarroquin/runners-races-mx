// Settings › Sessions archive — the permanent personal record of ground taken.
//
// The counterpart to the live map, and deliberately a different surface.
// Under CONQUEST the map and the leaderboard show ground you hold RIGHT NOW,
// which can fall while you sleep. That is the game. But it means the map
// stopped being a record, and "I took every street in this neighbourhood" is
// worth keeping — so it lives here, where nobody can take it.
//
// It draws ground by THE SAME RULE A RUN DOES: cells crossed, plus the
// interior of any loop a single session closed. Purely informative — nothing
// on this screen is scored, ranked or claimable.
//
// A run that could NOT claim does not appear here at all, and the comment
// this replaces claimed the opposite. claim_run_tiles raises CLAIM_TOO_OLD
// (and CLAIM_IMPLAUSIBLE) BEFORE its `insert into tile_visits`, so such a
// run writes no visit rows and this map has nothing to draw for it — while
// the runs row, and so the Saved tab's fence, is written either way. No run
// in production is in that state today (12 of 12 have tiles, checked
// 2026-09-09), which is exactly why the wrong comment survived: nothing
// contradicted it.

  // This is what was wrong before 2026-09-09: the screen drew visits ONLY,

  // Recomputed here rather than read back from territory_tiles, because
  // territory answers "what do I hold NOW" and conquest takes ground off
  // you. Recomputing from the append-only visit log is what keeps this a
  // permanent record.
  //
  // Privacy: these cells were already privacy-zone-trimmed on the way in
  // (see uploadRun), so enclosure derived from them cannot expose a home
  // loop the mask removed. The trade is that a loop closed only by its
  // masked-off ends does not enclose here even though it did at claim time

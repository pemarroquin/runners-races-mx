// The end-of-session territory map — WEB. Mapbox GL JS, same split rationale
// as track-map.web.tsx (the custom Studio style only renders in GL). Fully
// interactive; every captured fence is drawn (muted, each in its run's own
// colour), the run just finished gets a stronger fill, the ACTUAL RECORDED
// PATH is drawn as the vibrant gradient line, and the camera fits to it with
// an animated sweep.
//
// The route line used to be the fence POLYGON's boundary (outerRings(g)),
// not the path — structurally wrong two ways, both visible on a real out-
// and-back run (Web-First Pilot follow-up, reported by Pedro): a thin sliver
// polygon's boundary is two roughly-parallel strands that read as two
// unrelated routes, and buildFence's unkink/union step can return a
// MultiPolygon for any self-crossing run, which outerRings then emits as one
// LineString PER LOBE — literally disconnected segments. The route is now
// its OWN source/layer, drawn from the masked path (never the raw one — see
// index.tsx), and the polygon's boundary is demoted to a thin, low-opacity
// line that still communicates the claimed shape without competing with the
// route for "this is where I ran".
//
// The new fence's fill fades in via a paint transition — GL interpolates
// fill-opacity on the GPU, same trick as the wall rise on the live map.
//
// The route's gradient FLOWS along the line (gradient-flow.ts), the same
// continuous loop the live Track map runs mid-session and the Territories
// map runs on every saved territory — so the surface a run lands on doesn't
// read as a frozen still of the map it just left.
//
// Every custom layer sets a `slot` and `*-emissive-strength` — see
// track-map.web.tsx's header and constants/map.ts. The gradient layers also
// get a fallback `line-color` and stage their real data through setData()
// after an empty addSource(), same as the live route — it was rendering pure
// black (Mapbox's default line-color) despite line-gradient being set and
// lineMetrics being true (P3 §7c).

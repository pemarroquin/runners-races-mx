// My Achievements' map — WEB (Leaderboard's personal tab, achievements-view.tsx
// — formerly the Saved tab's Territories map, myraces.tsx, before the
// 2026-09-17 nav restructure). Every saved territory at once, fit to bounds
// around all of them (Pedro's call, 2026-09-02: "a single map view", however
// far the spread — no per-city scoping). Replaces the original screen's old
// FlatList of fence-card rows.
//
// Two visual states, matching Pedro's explicit spec:
//   SAVED — full treatment, same as the just-finished-run map (fence-map.
//   web.tsx): this run's own colour (fenceColorForRun), a vertical
//   fill-extrusion wall with opacity (matching the live Track map's fence
//   wall — see constants/map.ts's FENCE_WALL_HEIGHT_M/OPACITY), the vibrant
//   route gradient, and a chromatic rim traced around the territory's own
//   boundary. Both gradients FLOW — the same continuous loop the live Track
//   map runs on its route and its fill rim (gradient-flow.ts), so a saved
//   territory reads as the same living surface as a session in progress,
//   with the ramp travelling once around each territory's edge.
//   PENDING (queued, not yet uploaded — see upload-queue.ts) — flat, no
//   extrusion, a single desaturated grey, dashed outline, no gradient. Reads
//   at a glance as "not confirmed yet" without inventing new iconography.
//   Promotes to SAVED automatically the moment its upload succeeds (the
//   caller just stops passing it in `queued` and starts passing it in
//   `fences` — this component has no idea a promotion happened, it just
//   re-renders from new props).
//
// Tapping either kind's fill fires onSelect(id, kind) — the caller (myraces.
// tsx) owns the detail bubble/card, this component only owns the map.
//
// SCALING CAVEAT, deliberate simplification: each fence gets its OWN
// Mapbox source + 2-3 layers (mirroring fence-map.web.tsx's per-feature
// gradient-route technique, looped) rather than one shared source for all
// of them — Mapbox's line-gradient needs per-feature `line-progress` via
// lineMetrics, which does not compose cleanly across a FeatureCollection of
// many LineStrings sharing one source. Fine for the tens of territories a
// runner accumulates early on; would need revisiting if that count grows
// into the hundreds (batch into a shared source, drop the per-run gradient
// in favour of a single flat colour per run).

/**
 * Fills a gradient line source on the NEXT frame instead of baking the data
 * straight into addSource(). Not ceremony: fence-map.web.tsx hit a layer
 * that rendered pure black — line-gradient's silent fallback — with
 * lineMetrics:true and a valid expression already set, and going through
 * setData() after an empty source is the one thing proven to make GL JS
 * compute line-progress for it (P3 §7c). Both gradient layers here were
 * baking their data in directly, the shape that failed there.
 *
 * The layer can be removed before the frame lands (a delete, or a pending
 * run promoted to saved mid-flight), so this re-checks the source exists.
 *
 * And the MAP can be gone by then too — leaving the Territories tab in the
 * same frame runs the mount effect's cleanup, which calls map.remove() and
 * leaves mapbox-gl's `style` undefined behind it. `getSource` is then itself
 * what throws, so the "does the source exist" check below is not a guard
 * against that, it IS the crash (exactly the shape that blanked the app on
 * every Finish tap from track-map.web.tsx's shimmer cleanup — see CLAUDE.md).
 * Ask isLive() FIRST; never question a destroyed map.

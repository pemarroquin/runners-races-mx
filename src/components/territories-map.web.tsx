// The Territories tab's map — WEB. Every saved territory at once, fit to
// bounds around all of them (Pedro's call, 2026-09-02: "a single map view",
// however far the spread — no per-city scoping). Replaces myraces.tsx's old
// FlatList of fence-card rows.
//
// Two visual states, matching Pedro's explicit spec:
//   SAVED — full treatment, same as the just-finished-run map (fence-map.
//   web.tsx): this run's own colour (fenceColorForRun), a vertical
//   fill-extrusion wall with opacity (matching the live Track map's fence
//   wall — see constants/map.ts's FENCE_WALL_HEIGHT_M/OPACITY), the vibrant
//   route gradient, and a chromatic rim traced around the territory's own
//   boundary. Both gradients FLOW — the same continuous loop the live Track
//   map runs on its route and its fill rim (gradient-flow.ts), so a saved
//   territory reads as the same living surface as a session in progress,
//   with the ramp travelling once around each territory's edge.
//   PENDING (queued, not yet uploaded — see upload-queue.ts) — flat, no
//   extrusion, a single desaturated grey, dashed outline, no gradient. Reads
//   at a glance as "not confirmed yet" without inventing new iconography.
//   Promotes to SAVED automatically the moment its upload succeeds (the
//   caller just stops passing it in `queued` and starts passing it in
//   `fences` — this component has no idea a promotion happened, it just
//   re-renders from new props).
//
// Tapping either kind's fill fires onSelect(id, kind) — the caller (myraces.
// tsx) owns the detail bubble/card, this component only owns the map.
//
// SCALING CAVEAT, deliberate simplification: each fence gets its OWN
// Mapbox source + 2-3 layers (mirroring fence-map.web.tsx's per-feature
// gradient-route technique, looped) rather than one shared source for all
// of them — Mapbox's line-gradient needs per-feature `line-progress` via
// lineMetrics, which does not compose cleanly across a FeatureCollection of
// many LineStrings sharing one source. Fine for the tens of territories a
// runner accumulates early on; would need revisiting if that count grows
// into the hundreds (batch into a shared source, drop the per-run gradient
// in favour of a single flat colour per run).

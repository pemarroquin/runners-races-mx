// The Track tab's map — NATIVE. A live react-native-maps MapView (Apple Maps
// on iOS, Google on Android; both ship inside Expo Go), replacing the static
// Mapbox image this file used to render.
//
// The static image was why the tab felt broken on device: it had no camera —
// no fly-in when a session started, no follow while running — and the pin
// only moved when a whole new image URL was fetched, throttled and quantised,
// so on a phone it read as frozen on the first fix. A real MapView fixes all
// of that, and `showsUserLocation` adds the OS's own blue dot, which tracks
// the device continuously and independently of our JS fix stream.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT have, versus track-map.web.tsx: the custom
// Mapbox Studio style (a Mapbox GL SDK needs a dev client, which would break
// the Expo Go testing workflow), and the extruded 3D fence wall — no
// fill-extrusion primitive here, so claimed ground renders as a flat filled
// polygon (tilePolys below) instead of a raised wall. The camera
// choreography — idle follow, fly-in to a tilted close-up on start, the
// follow/overview mode cycle while running — uses the same constants as web
// so both platforms feel like the same feature; see src/lib/camera.ts for
// the shared pure geometry.
//
// P4 native gap this file used to leave unfixed: it accepted zoomInLabel /
// zoomOutLabel / recenterLabel purely for interface parity with
// track-map.web.tsx and drew NO camera controls at all — a runner on
// Android/iOS had no way to zoom, recenter, or see the whole route, and the
// camera was hardcoded `heading: 0` (never rotated to face the direction of
// travel). Both are fixed below, reusing this repo's existing camera-control
// button language 1:1 with web.

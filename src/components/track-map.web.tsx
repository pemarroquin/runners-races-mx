// Track tab map — WEB. A real Mapbox GL JS map, not the static image the
// native file uses.
//
// This split exists because of a hard API limit, not preference: the Static
// Images API cannot render Mapbox Standard styles (the `imports`-based kind
// Studio creates by default) — it returns a blank image, no error. GL JS
// renders them fine, so the custom Studio style can only be used here. See
// constants/map.ts.
//
// GL JS also buys what a baked PNG structurally cannot: a gradient route
// line, an extruded 3D fence, and a camera that moves. The route renders in
// two pieces while running — see fence-3d.ts for the split.
//
// mapbox-gl is loaded by dynamic import and its CSS by a runtime <link>, both
// copied from route-map.web.tsx — see that file's header for why the CSS
// cannot be a JS import (Metro hoists every CSS module into one global,
// render-blocking stylesheet regardless of the import being dynamic).
//
// Every custom layer sets a `slot` and `*-emissive-strength` — see
// constants/map.ts's MAP_SLOT_ROUTE / MAP_SLOT_FILL / EMISSIVE_STRENGTH_FULL.
// Standard shades custom layers by the style's own light preset like any
// basemap layer (this style's Standard import sets lightPreset: 'night'),
// which is why every route/wall colour used to render at roughly a third of
// its intended brightness (P3 §7a).
//
// There is exactly ONE traced line on this map: ROUTE_SRC (plus its blurred
// glow twin), fed the live edge of the newest leg. There used to be a second
// pair — an enclosure fill and its gradient rim, built by buildFence() over
// the whole growing path. buildFence AUTO-CLOSES the path into a ring, so
// drawing that ring's boundary as a LineString put three artefacts on screen
// at once (reported with screenshots 2026-09-08):
//   1. a straight chord from the runner's live position back to the start,
//      cutting across ground nobody ran (through the middle of a park);
//   2. what looked like a duplicated route — the ring traces the path
//      itself, so an out-and-back drew BOTH its sides alongside ROUTE_SRC,
//      three parallel lines for one run;
//   3. a fill shading the enclosed area as claimed, which under the tile
//      coverage model it is not.
// Territory is the H3 tile footprint (TILES_SRC/WALL_SRC), never an
// enclosure — see gap-policy.ts. Both the native track map and the saved-run
// summary (fence-map.web.tsx) already draw tiles only; this brings the web
// track map to parity. Do not reintroduce an enclosure outline here.
//
// One thing animates continuously while a session is live, so the map
// doesn't read as flat/static even when the runner is standing still: the
// route line flows ROUTE_GRADIENT along itself via gradient-flow.ts. It's a
// plain setInterval timer, not a requestAnimationFrame loop — see the
// pulse-dot comment below.

          where pinch is not. Bottom-right, matching where a thumb naturally
          rests; the app's own circular-button language (see index.tsx's
          RoundButton), not Mapbox's NavigationControl — foreign styling,
          and its compass would be meaningless with rotation disabled.

          The mode-cycle button is ALWAYS rendered here, never conditionally
          mounted — that was problem 1's root cause (a pinch to max zoom
          didn't write preferredZoomRef, so 5s later auto-return yanked the
          camera back to SESSION_ZOOM AND hid the button in the same
          instant). Its icon/label reflect the action a tap performs next,
          not the current mode: 'map' while in follow (tap → overview),
          'my_location' while in overview (tap → follow, reusing the same
          icon/copy as the old always-present recenter button). Fixed order
          — it and the +/- buttons never mount/unmount, so this cluster
          never shifts. */}

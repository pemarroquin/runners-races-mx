//
// - Mapbox GL JS (web) renders **Mapbox Standard** styles — the new
//   `imports`-based architecture Studio creates by default. That's what
//   MAP_STYLE_GL is.
// - The Static Images API (native, where Expo Go can't load a GL SDK) does
//   NOT render Standard styles. It returns a blank image rather than an
//   error — verified 2026-08-26: the custom style and `mapbox/standard`
//   both came back essentially empty (5KB / 85B) while `mapbox/dark-v11`
//   returned a real 27KB map. So native falls back to a stock classic dark
//   style that looks close.
//
// If the two ever need to match exactly, the fix is to rebuild the custom
// style from a *classic* template in Studio (not Standard) and point both
// constants at it.

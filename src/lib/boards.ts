// The leaderboard's district-scoped read.
//
// Filters SERVER-SIDE by the district's H3 prefix (districtCellPattern)
// rather than pulling a table down and truncating every id on device — this
// repo has already shipped a leaderboard that silently ranked a truncated
// 1000-row sample (see fetchTileLeaderboard's own paging comment).
//
// NEEDS NO MIGRATION, which is the point. `tile_visits` already has a `read
// all` policy, opened when the table was created for exactly this ("other
// runners' tile_visits eventually for the Layer 2 rolling board"). Migrations
// here are applied BY HAND and an unapplied one reads as an honest zero, so
// a board that needs no SQL cannot be broken by forgetting to run any.
//
// A park-path read used to live here and was deleted 2026-09-09 — at the
// time, `park_path_cells` was genuinely empty in production, so the read fed
// nothing and the conquest denominator moved to claimed ground instead (see
// leaderboard.ts's ConquestEntry.share; that change stands). The table was
// loaded the same day (36,193 cells, see BACKLOG). `fetchDistrictParkCells`
// is restored ONLY for district.ts's districtLabel — a decorative caption,
// never a score — not for any denominator.

/**
 * The district's visits: Board 2's raw material.
 *
 * Everyone's, not just this device's — mayorship is a contest, so the whole
 * district's visits are needed to decide who holds each cell. The window is
 * applied CLIENT-SIDE in mayorByCell rather than as a `gte` here, on purpose:
 * one function owns what "inside the window" means, so the fetch and the
 * ranking can never disagree about it, and MAYORSHIP_WINDOW_DAYS stays a
 * single constant to tune.
 *
 * Ceiling, stated because it will arrive: tile_visits grows by roughly the
 * number of cells a run touches directly (~160 for a 3 km run — visits, not
 * enclosure). The district prefix keeps this proportional to one arena rather
 * than the whole table, and `tile_visits` has no index usable by a prefix
 * LIKE (its indexes are on user_id and run_id), so this is a sequential scan.
 * Fine at 1,745 rows; when it is not, the fix is an RPC that returns
 * mayorship per cell, not more paging here.

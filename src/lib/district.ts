// The ARENA — the piece of ground a leaderboard is a claim about.
//
// This replaces the leaderboard's old region/global pill pair, and it is a
// deliberate rejection of administrative boundaries. The reasoning is
// measured, not aesthetic.
//
// WHY NOT THE MUNICIPIO, which is what was asked for first. Nothing in this
// app can resolve a lat/lng to a municipio: `regions.ts` is METRO-level
// (Monterrey is one region spanning seven municipios) and no boundary
// polygons are stored anywhere. The cheap substitute — truncate the 36,193
// stored park-path cells to a coarse H3 parent and read the municipio off
// that — was measured and does not work: at res 7, 21.3% of parent cells
// straddle two municipios, and at res 6, 50.0%. Monterrey's municipios
// interlock too tightly. A runner standing in San Nicolás would routinely be
// told they are competing in Monterrey. Real boundaries would fix it, at the
// price of an Overpass pass, a PostGIS table, a hand-applied migration and a
// round trip on every location change — and they would still only cover the
// municipios somebody extracted.
//
// WHY AN H3 CELL. It is what the games that actually solved this do: Pokémon
// GO and Ingress never reverse-geocode to administrative regions at all —
// their S2 grid IS the region, and gyms, nests and regional scoring are all
// cell-indexed. CityStrides and Wandrer take the other road (OSM admin
// boundaries) and pay a PostGIS table per city plus a server round trip for
// it. Foursquare's mayorship, which this app's second board is modelled on,
// needs a venue database — which is the naming this product has rejected.
//
// So: `latLngToCell(lat, lng, DISTRICT_RES)` is exactly where you are.
// Computed locally in microseconds, offline, with no table, no migration, no
// round trip, no ambiguity by construction, anywhere on Earth, at zero
// marginal cost. The 21% ambiguity above is entirely an artifact of forcing
// the grid onto administrative lines; drop the lines and it disappears.
//
// The cost of this choice, stated plainly: a district has no human name. That
// is what `districtLabel` is for, and the label is DECORATIVE — nothing
// ranks, filters or scores by it. See its own comment.

 * was 15x smaller, which DOES NOT EXIST").
 *
 * Chosen for contestability, which is the only thing that matters here: a
 * 5 km run crosses a res-7 district, so one session can plausibly change who
 * leads it. The neighbours are both wrong for that —
 *
 *   res 6: 36.13 km², 7.46 km across. Too big to move; a good run barely
 *          dents it, which is the same "years or never" failure the park-path
 *          denominator was chosen to avoid (see park_paths.sql).
 *   res 8:  0.74 km², 1.07 km across. Too small to be a fight — you would
 *          hold your own street outright and never meet anyone.
 *
 * H3 steps by a factor of 7 in area per resolution, so there is nothing
 * between these. Do not go looking for an intermediate size.

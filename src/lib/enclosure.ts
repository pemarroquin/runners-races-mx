// Enclosure — the ground a runner surrounds, as opposed to the ground they
// physically cover (tiles.ts). Owner's call, 2026-09-07: "a loop around a
// park earns you the perimeter and everything inside it."
//
// This is the Qix / Paper.io mechanic, expressed on the H3 grid the app
// already scores on rather than on polygon area. That distinction is the
// whole safety argument, because the enclosure model was ALREADY TRIED here
// and abandoned: a 3.3 km one-way run auto-closed into a 977,565 m² fence
// (see supabase/migrations/20260903120000_tile_coverage.sql and the
// anti-cheat evidence doc). What made that possible was AUTO-CLOSING —
// joining two endpoints the runner never connected. Nothing here does that:
//
//   - The only input is the set of cells the runner actually covered. A
//     hole exists only where their own cells form a closed ring around it.
//   - An open path encloses nothing. The 3.3 km exploit yields zero.
//   - A gap in the loop LEAKS. If a background interruption left a hole in
//     the ring, the region is no longer enclosed and nothing is claimed —
//     so "never connect across a gap" stops being a rule this code has to
//     remember and becomes a property of the geometry. See gap-policy.ts.
//
// ONLY YOUR OWN TILES ARE WALLS. This function is given one runner's cells
// and nothing else, so a rival's tiles can never serve as part of your
// boundary — you cannot enclose a neighbourhood by using someone else's run
// as three of its four sides. That rule is satisfied by construction rather
// than by a check, which is why there is no rival parameter here.
//
// Pure — no React, no network. Same testing philosophy as tiles.ts.

/**
 * Every region this cell set surrounds, ONE ARRAY PER HOLE.
 *
 * Works off H3's own dissolve: cellsToMultiPolygon merges a cell set into
 * outlines, and an enclosed empty region comes back as a HOLE in one of
 * those outlines (ring index 1+). Filling each hole with polygonToCells
 * yields exactly the interior — verified against gridRing/gridDisk in
 * enclosure.test.ts, where the interior of a radius-3 ring is precisely
 * gridDisk(2).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a flood fill from a bounding box. Both give the same
 * answer, but the bbox version has to enumerate every cell in the
 * rectangle around the run — tens of thousands for a long loop, most of
 * them outside it — while this only ever touches the enclosed region
 * itself.
 *
 * The single place the dissolve → hole-ring → fill pipeline is written.
 * `enclosedCells` and `noiseHoles` are both thin wrappers over it, and
 * `npm run measure-holes` reports on it, so there is no second copy to
 * drift. That is not a style preference here: gap-policy.ts exists only
 * because the recorder and the tile builder each applied the caps
 * themselves and disagreed about one real gap, and verify-claims.ts runs
 * the app's own functions for the same reason.
 *
 * Kept as one array PER HOLE rather than one flat set because the size of
 * an individual hole is a decision input — see noiseHoles' cap. Callers that
 * do not care flatten it.
 *
 * GeoJSON winding ([lng, lat]) from both h3 calls, so the rings handed to
 * polygonToCells are already in the order it expects.

 * size around the home, and three runs determine its centre — the attack
 * privacy-zone.ts's jitter exists to defeat. Passing the nominal radius
 * here would mask the path correctly and then leak the home through the
 * tiles instead.

 * overshoot at about half a tile (~5 m) against a cut of 200 m or more.

 * IDENTICAL result — 39 holes filled, 50 cells. 6 sits in the middle of that
 * empty band with roughly 3x margin before it could start absorbing real
 * ground.
 *

 * are 11-12 HECTARES, 648 m and 1 125 m across. Those are city-block
 * interiors and gated land somebody ran around, and claiming them is exactly
 * the "invent territory" failure this whole file was written to avoid (see
 * the header, and gap-policy.ts's bridge caps for the same shape of rule
 * applied to time and distance).
 *
 * Why a cell COUNT and not an area or a width: the count is what the fill
 * actually operates on, so a cap expressed in cells cannot drift from what
 * it gates. The metre figures above are reported by measure-holes for
 * judging the number, not for computing it.
 *
 * Re-run `npm run measure-holes` before changing this. The gap in the
 * distribution is the argument; a different city with different block sizes
 * could put the boundary somewhere else.

 *
 * The case that motivated it: a runner's history had black hexagons inside
 * a band they had run dozens of times (reported with a screenshot,

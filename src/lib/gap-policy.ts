// Shared gap plausibility policy — the ONE pair of caps that decide whether
// a GPS gap (missing fixes between two recorded points) is close enough to
// "a runner briefly out of GPS view" to act on, or far enough away that we
// must leave the hole alone.
//
// Before this module existed the two subsystems that each face this exact
// question disagreed with each other. tiles.ts already had these caps and
// used them to decide whether to draw gap-fill H3 cells across a gap.
// tracking.ts's distanceM accumulator used NO caps at all: a
// visibilitychange gap was ALWAYS excluded from distanceM regardless of how
// short or slow it was, while a GPS-stall gap of the identical physical
// shape (no visibilitychange fired, the watch stayed alive the whole time)
// was ALWAYS included, because tracking.ts never broke the leg for it. The
// 2026-09-02 geometry audit (see `Source Data/Outputs/Running App/Geometry
// Audit — Saved Runs vs Recomputed (2026-09-02).md`, one level above this
// repo) measured that disagreement directly on real saved runs: on run
// `68e32c11`, the tile builder bridged straight through a clean 76s/105.9m
// leg-break gap (105.9m is under MAX_BRIDGE_DISTANCE_M, 5.0 km/h is far
// under MAX_BRIDGE_SPEED_MS) while the recorder's distance total excluded
// that exact same chord. Same physical event, two different answers.
//
// Both subsystems now import the caps from here so they can never
// independently drift again. Do not fork a second copy of either number.
//
// IMPORTANT — this governs DISTANCE credit and TILE gap-fill only, never
// GEOMETRY. Crediting a gap's chord to a distance total is a scalar claim
// ("the runner covered at least this much ground in this much time"), which
// two real timestamped fixes and a straight-line lower bound support.
// Nothing here inserts a point into a recorded path or changes what
// buildFence() sees — that would fabricate territory nobody proved they
// held. See this repo's "never connect across a gap" rule.

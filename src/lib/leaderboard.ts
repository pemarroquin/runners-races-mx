// Phase 2 — leaderboard aggregation. Pure functions over rows already
// fetched, so the ranking maths is unit-testable without a network or a
// database, same philosophy as territory.ts and races.ts.
//
// WHY THIS IS CLIENT-SIDE, not the `ST_Union ... group by user_id` query in
// the feature plan: PostgREST can't express that aggregate, so it would need
// a Postgres function — and migrations in this project are applied BY HAND
// (see CLAUDE.md). An unapplied one fails silently and reads as "nobody has
// any territory", which is indistinguishable from an empty board. Turf is
// already a dependency and the union pipeline already exists here, so this
// path works the moment a run is saved, with no setup step that can be
// forgotten.
//
// The union is NOT optional and summing `area_m2` is not a shortcut: running
// the same loop twice would otherwise count that ground twice. Overlapping
// runs by one user collapse into the area actually held — which is the whole
// definition of the score.
//
// Ceiling: this fetches every fence geometry to aggregate them on device.
// Fine at friends scale (tens of runs); if the board ever gets slow, the fix
// is the `profile_stats` table in the plan (a trigger unions just the one
// user's rows per insert, so write cost stays flat) — at which point this
// file becomes a fallback rather than the primary path.

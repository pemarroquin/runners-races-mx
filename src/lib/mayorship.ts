// BOARD 2 — Local Leaders. Mayorship over ground you keep coming back to.
//
// Board 1 (conquest, see leaderboard.ts) answers "who holds this ground right
// now" and changes hands the moment somebody else runs there. This answers
// the other question — "who actually runs here" — and cannot be taken with a
// single visit. Pedro's example is the spec: Daniel runs his local park 365
// days, a rival runs it 362, Daniel holds it. One point per DAY, so a rival
// cannot buy the title with one enormous Sunday.
//
// WHAT REPLACED AREAS, and why this file exists at all. Board 2 used to rank
// user-created `areas`: a runner closed a loop, was asked to NAME it, and
// became its Legend. That was rejected outright — "why are we naming loops
// and shit" — and the rejection was right for a reason beyond taste: the
// runner who draws the shape is the only one who knows it exists, so they
// draw it around their own daily route and hold it uncontested. (The backlog
// spotted that risk and answered it by requiring shapes to be public, which
// still leaves someone inventing and naming a place.)
//
// The unit is now THE GRID ITSELF. Mayorship is per H3 cell, decided by days
// present. Nothing is declared, named, or drawn:
//
//   - Daniel's park works, because his route covers those cells every day.
//   - "Some street block near my house" works identically, with no special
//     case, no polygon and no name — the ask that settled this design.
//   - Areas EMERGE. Contiguous cells you are mayor of dissolve into one
//     shape (cellsToMultiPolygon, as everywhere else in this codebase), so
//     "your turf" is drawn from what you actually run rather than declared
//     in advance.
//
// PURE, on rows already fetched — same philosophy as leaderboard.ts and
// territory.ts, and the reason this suite (`environment: 'node'`, no
// renderer, no Postgres) can cover the mechanic completely.

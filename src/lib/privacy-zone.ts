// Privacy zones — keeps the start and end of a run away from where you live
// before anything is uploaded.
//
// THE PROBLEM. Territory Mode uploads a GPS path and a fence polygon to a
// database whose read policy is open (`runs: read all`) and whose anon key
// ships inside the app bundle. Anyone who has the app can read every run.
// If you start and finish at your front door, that door is in the data.
//
// WHY THE HOME POINT NEVER LEAVES THE DEVICE. The feature plan suggested
// storing it in `profiles.home_point`, which already exists in the schema —
// but `profiles` carries `for select using (true)`, so writing a home point
// there would publish every user's address to every other user. That is
// strictly worse than the problem being solved. So the home point lives in
// local prefs (db.ts) and the masking happens HERE, client-side, before
// upload. The column stays empty; 0002 drops it so nobody fills it later.
//
// WHY THE RADIUS IS RANDOMISED. This is the part that is easy to get wrong.
// Clipping at a FIXED radius R puts the first surviving point of every run
// on a circle of radius R centred on your home. Three runs give three points
// on that circle, and three points determine a circle — so a fixed radius
// hands an attacker the exact centre. This is not hypothetical; it is how
// Strava's privacy zones were defeated in published work. Randomising the
// cut per run scatters the endpoints across an annulus instead, which has no
// unique centre to solve for.
//
// WHY THE FENCE ISN'T CLIPPED DIRECTLY. Cutting a circular bite out of the
// finished polygon would draw a literal circle around the house — the
// clearest possible signal. Instead the PATH is trimmed and the fence is
// rebuilt from the trimmed path: buildFence auto-closes any shape, so the
// boundary near home becomes an ordinary straight chord, indistinguishable
// from someone who simply ran a slightly different loop.

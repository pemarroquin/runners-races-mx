// The deep-link fix: `web.output: "single"` emits ONE index.html, and
// Porkbun's static hosting serves files by path with no SPA rewrite, so any
// URL without a real file behind it returns openresty's 404 — on every hard
// reload and every shared link. Measured against the live site on
// 2026-09-09: / was 200, /races /leaderboard /settings/location all 404,
// while /race/<id> was 200 because those files were being written.
//
// So these pin the enumeration that writes the rest. The failure mode is
// silent and only shows up on a phone, on the deployed site, after a reload
// — nothing in tsc, lint or the export can see it.
